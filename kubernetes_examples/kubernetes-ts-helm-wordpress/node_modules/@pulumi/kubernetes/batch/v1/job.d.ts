 * The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
 * succeeded or failed:
 *
 * 1. The Job's '.status.startTime' is set, which indicates that the Job has started running.
 * 2. The Job's '.status.conditions' has a status of type 'Complete', and a 'status' set
 *    to 'True'.
 * 3. The Job's '.status.conditions' do not have a status of type 'Failed', with a
 *     'status' set to 'True'. If this condition is set, we should fail the Job immediately.
 *
 * If the Job has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
 * time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
 * by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
