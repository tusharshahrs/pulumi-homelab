# Azure Serverless Workshop with Pulumi

This hands-on workshop will walk you through various tasks of managing Azure infrastructure with the focus on serverless compute and managed Azure services. All the resources are provisioned with [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com) in the infrastructure-as-code fashion. You will deploy an Azure Function App with HTTP-triggered serverless functions.

## Lab 2: Deploying Serverless Applications with Azure Functions

This lab assumes you have setup Pulumi and configured Azure. If you don't have these
steps completed, please complete the [prerequisities](../00-installing-prerequisites.md)
